## 1. Introduction

Chilli Care is a web-based application that uses artificial intelligence to help farmers and agricultural professionals identify diseases in chilli plants. You simply take or upload a photo of a chilli leaf, and the system will analyse it and tell you what disease is present — along with recommended treatments.

**What the system can detect:**

| Disease | Type |
|---|---|
| Chilli Whitefly | Pest infestation |
| Chilli Yellowish | Nutrient deficiency / stress |
| Chilli Anthracnose | Fungal disease |
| Chilli Leaf Curl Virus | Viral disease |
| Healthy Plant | No disease detected |

The full disease reference guide inside the platform covers 31 conditions in total.

## 2. Getting Started — Accessing the System

**Step 1.** Open a web browser on your computer or mobile device (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge are all supported).

**Step 2.** Type the application address into the browser address bar and press **Enter**.

- On a local network: `http://<server-ip-address>:5000`
- On your own machine: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

**Step 3.** The Chilli Care home page will load. From here you can register, log in, or use the detection tool as a guest.

> **Note:** A stable internet connection is required for AI-powered image validation and for loading the application on the first visit.

---

**Step 1.** On the home page, click the **Sign Up** button in the top navigation bar.

**Step 2.** Fill in the registration form:
- **Full Name** — Your first and last name.
- **Email Address** — A valid email you have access to.

**Step 3.** Click the **Create Account** button.

**Step 4.** If all fields are correct, your account will be created and you will be logged in automatically.

**Step 2.** Enter your registered **email address** and **password**.

**Step 3.** Click the **Login** button.

## 5. Detecting a Chilli Disease

This is the core feature of Chilli Care. Follow the steps below to get an AI diagnosis for your chilli plant.

### Option A — Upload an Image from Your Device

**Step 1.** On the home page, locate the **Disease Detection** panel.

**Step 2.** Click the **Upload Image** area (or drag and drop an image file onto it).

**Step 3.** Select a photo from your device. Accepted formats are **JPG**, **JPEG**, and **PNG**.

**Step 4.** A preview of the selected image will appear on screen.

**Step 5.** Click the **Analyze Disease** button.

**Step 6.** Wait 2–5 seconds while the AI processes your image.

**Step 7.** Your results will appear below the image automatically.

---

### Option B — Capture a Photo Using Your Camera

**Step 1.** On the home page, click the **Camera** button inside the detection panel.

**Step 2.** Your browser will ask for permission to access your camera. Click **Allow**.

**Step 3.** A live camera preview will appear. If your device has a front and back camera, use the **Switch Camera** button to toggle between them.

**Step 4.** Position your chilli leaf clearly within the camera frame, then click **Capture**.

**Step 5.** A preview of the captured photo will appear.

**Step 6.** Click **Analyze Disease** to run the detection.

> **Important:** For the most accurate result, photograph the **leaf** of the plant in good lighting. Avoid blurry or dark images. The AI will reject images that do not appear to be chilli plant leaves.

## 6. Understanding Your Results

After analysis, the system displays a detailed results panel. Here is what each section means:

| Result Section | What It Tells You |
|---|---|
| **Disease Name** | The detected condition (e.g., "Chilli Leaf Curl Virus") |
| **Confidence Score** | How certain the AI is — shown as a percentage (e.g., 94.2%) |
| **Probability Chart** | A breakdown of likelihood scores across all 5 detectable classes |
| **Symptoms** | Key visual signs associated with the detected disease |
| **Cause** | The biological or environmental reason for the condition |
| **Treatment Recommendations** | Chemical or conventional treatment options |
| **Organic Solutions** | Natural and eco-friendly treatment alternatives |
| **Prevention Tips** | Steps to avoid the disease in future plantings |
| **Prognosis Card** | Estimated plant life expectancy, expected yield impact, and next likely disease risk |
| **Location** | Your automatically detected district (based on your IP address) |

> **Reminder:** Results are generated by an AI model and are intended as guidance. Always consult a qualified agricultural professional before applying treatments.
